# Introduction
The red-Black tree is a binary search tree.Each node in the Red-black tree contains an extra bit that represents a color to ensure that the tree is balanced during any operations performed on the tree like insertion, deletion, etc. In a binary search tree, the searching, insertion and deletion take O(log2n) time in the average case, O(1) in the best case and O(n) in the worst case.
# Rules for red black tree:
<br>Every node has a color either red or black.
<br>The root of the tree is always black.
<br>There are no two adjacent red nodes (A red node cannot have a red parent or red child).
<br>Every path from a node (including root) to any of its descendants NULL nodes has the same number of black nodes.
<br>All leaf nodes are black nodes.
